# hackernews
Using functional composition to create a paginated and infinite scroll list component in React

The App component renders a form and a list. The form is used as input to search for stories on the Hacker News platform. Submitting the form leads to a request to the Hacker News API. Once the search request succeeds, the list is used to display the list of stories.
